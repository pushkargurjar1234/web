    <p>Golden hues kiss the sky, As the sun dips low to sigh. Clouds blush, their edges aflame, Whispering secrets in twilight’s name.

        Birds gather on the wire, Chirping tales of day’s retire. Trees sway, a gentle dance, Bidding farewell with elegance.
        
        Stars peek through the velvet veil, Winking, as if to say, “All is well.” Night tiptoes in, a silent guest, And the world rests, cradled and blessed.</p>
